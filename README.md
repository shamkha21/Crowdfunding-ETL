# Crowdfunding-ETL 
## Purpose  
The purpose of this project was to use Python, Pandas and Jupyter notebook to exact and transform CSv data on a crowdfunding file and then analyze that data in SQL. I was successfully able to analyze and reflect data that demonstrated the amount remaining for fundraising and the correct names and email address tied to the successful fundraisers.
